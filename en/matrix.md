# Matrix Chat

We, the de-RSE association and its surrounding community, use the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) protocol for asynchronous communication.

On this page, we document how you can find our channels and give a few pointers to get you started using Matrix chat, in case you are new to the ecosystem.

## Our Space and Channels

We grouped our channel using a space: <TBD> .

Currently, we are moderating the following channels:

- <TBD1>

## Matrix Chat

Matrix is a decentralized communication protocol that supports chat, voice and video calls.
The protocol is an open standard and there are multiple clients available.
A key feature of Matrix is that every chat, including group chats, can be end-to-end encrypted (but we recommend against it in some cases: more to that below).

### How to Start

You need a Matrix account to use it.
Since Matrix is a decentralized system, there is no single place to create an account.

If your institution hosts a Matrix server, you might want to create your account there (or it already exists, without your knowledge). A somewhat current map of scientific institutions that use matrix is maintained at TU Dresden:

![Map of Germany with Matrix logos marking institutions that run a Matrix server. Clicking on a logo will navigate to the respective service.](https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de/images/federation_map.svg)

Otherwise, you can create an account on the generic instance matrix.org.
You can find [information on how to do that](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/) in their documentation.

### Recommended Clients

We recommend to use the [Element client](https://element.io/download) for all major platforms.
It supports most features of the Matrix protocol and is a somewhat resource hungry.
If the latter is a problem for you, you might want to have a look [other client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/).

If you do not want to or cannot install a client on your platform, you can use a web client.
Your home server might host a web client itself.
But in any case, you can use the web client hosted by the developers of Element: <https://app.element.io/>
