# Matrix Chat

We, the de-RSE association and its surrounding community, use [Matrix](https://matrix.org) for asynchronous communication (chatting).

On this page, we document how you can find our rooms and give a few pointers to get you started using Matrix chat, in case you are new to the ecosystem.

## Our Space and Rooms

We grouped our rooms using a space: https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org:matrix.org

Currently, we are moderating the following rooms:

[deRSE-general](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-general:matrix.org)
: For general discussions that are de-RSE related, but fit in no other room.
[deRSE-introductions](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-introductions:matrix.org)
: For (new) community members introducing themselves.
[deRSE-jobs](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-jobs:matrix.org)
: For RSE related job announcements from the community.
[deRSE-events](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-events:matrix.org)
: For RSE related event announcements from the community.
[deRSE-offtopic](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-offtopic:matrix.org)
: For anything not related to de-RSE, but that one might want to discuss with the de-RSE community.

### Additional Rooms

On Matrix everyone can create their own rooms.
Appropriate rooms, for example for local chapters or specific RSE topics, can be added to the de-RSE space.
If you want to have a room added to the de-RSE space, it has to fulfill the following requirements:

- The functional account @de-rse@matrix.org must be added with the admin role.
- The room must not be encrypted so the history is readable by joining users.
- The room should have logo.
  If there is nothing better fitting, you can use the [de-RSE logo]({{ "/assets/img/matrix/derse-matrix-log.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
- If the room’s topic is a de-RSE chapter, its name must be prefixed by `deRSE-chapter-`.
- At least one user, other than the functional account, must have the moderator role.

Once all the requirements are fulfilled please contact <TBD@TBD.TBD> to request addition of the room to the de-RSE space.

## Matrix Chat

Matrix is a decentralized communication protocol that supports chat, voice and video calls.
The protocol is an open standard and there are multiple clients available.
A key feature of Matrix is that every chat, including group chats, can be end-to-end encrypted (but we recommend against it in some cases: more to that below).

### How to Start

You need a Matrix account to use it.
Since Matrix is a decentralized system, there is no single place to create an account.

If your institution hosts a Matrix server, you might want to create your account there (or it already exists, without your knowledge). The TU Dresden maintains a [map of scientific institutions](https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de/images/federation_map.svg) in Germany (and some abroad) that host a Matrix server.

Otherwise, you can create an account on the generic instance matrix.org on <https://app.element.io>.
You can find further [information on the sign-up process](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/) in matrix.org’s documentation.

### Recommended Clients

We recommend to use the [Element client](https://element.io/download) for all major platforms.
It supports most features of the Matrix protocol, but is somewhat resource hungry.
If the latter is a problem for you, you might want to have a look at [other client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/).

If you do not want to or cannot install a client on your platform, you can use a web client.
Your home server might host a web client itself.
But in any case, you can use the web client hosted by the developers of Element: <https://app.element.io/>
