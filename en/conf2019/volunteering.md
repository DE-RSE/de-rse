# Volunteering

Conducting a conference like deRSE19 can only be successful with dedicated volunteers. Thats why we are looking for you: You do not only want to take part in the conference, but also to actively shape it, to provide technical and organizational support, and to look behind the scenes? Then become a volunteer!

## Full-time Volunteer

We are looking for volunteers who take over two half-day shifts (9am-1pm, 1pm-5pm) and therefore attend the conference for a [discounted price](registration.html). Also on June 4th is from 9 clock an introduction whose participation is mandatory. Organizational / logistical (helpdesk, reception, etc.) or technical tasks (support for lecturers, audio and video recordings) can be taken over. To become a full-time volunteer, simply purchase a volunteer ticket at [registration](registration.html).

## Part-time Volunteer

You want to support us, but you do not want to invest that much time? Then just contact us [contact us](contact.html).
