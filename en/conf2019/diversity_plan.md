**Equity**, **inclusion**, and **integrity** are essential values
of the RSE movement. Respect for these values will naturally result
in the full **diversity** of our community being present and visible
at this conference. In this spirit, the organization team has taken
the following measures:

* **Code of conduct** - To remind participants of their individual
  responsibility for a friendly and inclusive atmosphere, we adopted
  the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/),
  prominently linked on the conference web site.
* **Committee diversity** – Members of the organization committee,
  members of technical committees, and reviewers have been
  recruited such that they are diverse with respect to research
  areas, level of experience, location, type of institution,
  and gender. Committees’ memberships will vary in future conferences.
* **Speaker diversity** – Similarly, speakers and panelists will be
  chosen to represent diverse backgrounds and interests.
* **Travel awards** – In addition to merit, interest to the community,
  and need, decisions about travel awards will consider diversity
  aspects with respect to demographic, institutional and geographic
  background, level of experience and funding situation.
* **Evaluation and tracking** - Feedback regarding conference
  atmosphere, equity, inclusion, integrity, and diversity will
  be collected and evaluated. Results, and registration statistics,
  will be forwarded to the organizers of the next conference for the
  benefit of future tracking, and used to inform diversity reports.
