We think this list of events is relevant. That's why simply collected them in a table. We are not the organizers of of these events!

## deRSE conferences

We organize the international **deRSE** conferences, by and for Research Software Engineers.

The 2nd conference of Research Software Engineers in Germany was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
_SORSE_ - A Series of Online Research Software Events - is jointly organised by international RSE groups and organisations in 2020 to make up for the numerous cancelled in-person meetings and conferences.
