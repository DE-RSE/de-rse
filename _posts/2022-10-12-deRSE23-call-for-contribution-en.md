[deRSE23](https://de-rse23.sciencesconf.org/), the third conference in Germany addressing research software and the people behind it within the German research landscape will be held at the Heinz Nixdorf Forum (HNF) in Paderborn on February 20-21, 2023.

The organising committee welcomes submissions for talks, posters and demos in English or German languange for the deRSE23 conference. The aim is to reflect the diverse community of research software engineers by seeking input from all levels of experience and across a variety of domains, geographic locations, genders, and ethnicities.

### Timeline
October 10, 2022 - We are open for submissions
November 21, 2022 - Deadline for submissions
December 12, 2022 - Open registration for conference
December 22, 2022 - Notification of acceptance and program
February 20-21, 2023 - deRSE23 conference

If your submission is accepted, at least one of the authors is expected to attend the conference to present. Please note that conference fees apply at registration.

### Conference sessions, themes and types of contribution
deRSE23 has no pre-defined thematic tracks. Instead, sessions will be inductively created by the programme committee from the submissions. If your submission addresses a topic that you think is of interest to the community of people involved in research software, we would love to see it submitted! We also prepared a [bazaar](https://pad.gwdg.de/Ay1cw9IQS1S5H2wD5nL2LQ), where you can connect with others and start a contribution collaboration. Please note the formats section below.

### Who should submit?
We welcome submissions from any and all people who have an interesting take on research software development, including:

- Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research purposes
- Software developers working in a research context, whatever their job title or field
- Funders and decision makers paving the way for sustainable research software with grants and other instruments
- Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use and maintain research software, e.g. with respect to openness, reproducibility, sustainability or scalability and performance
- People from any organisation providing tools, platforms or services that benefit research software, such as IT infrastructure providers or computing and data centres.

We’re aiming for a well-balanced programme that includes a wide variety of perspectives to reflect the diversity of the RSE community and its activities showcasing that software can be a language that furthers communication across the established domain boundaries. Similar conferences in other countries in the past found that social sciences and humanities were under-represented so we’d particularly like to encourage speakers from those areas to apply.
We are not just looking for seasoned presenters or people who are already well known. Thus, speakers from under-represented backgrounds and at early career stages are highly encouraged to submit a proposal.

We will select talks and workshops through a single-blind review process, i.e., reviewers will see authors’ names and affiliations. This supports software-related submissions better than a double-blind process.

### First-time presenter?
We want you to present! It’s important that the programme includes people who don’t normally publish papers, or give talks at academic conferences. We want your voice to be heard as part of the RSE community.

It’s not intimidating! deRSE23 is about learning from each other in a supportive atmosphere. Your perspective is welcome and needed, and presenting will be a great chance to start a wider discussion of issues you care about.

We can help! We can offer mentoring and other support with preparing your presentation. Please [email us](mailto:derse23orga@listserv.dfn.de) if you require advice or clarification before making a submission. We aim to offer one-on-one mentoring to help successful applicants prepare their talk, poster or workshop. If you would like a mentor to help you just tick the respective box when submitting your proposal/registration.

### Contact
If you have any questions about the conference, or the submission of proposals, please contact the conference organisers at [derse23orga@listserv.dfn.de](mailto:derse23orga@listserv.dfn.de).

### Technicalities
The focus of deRSE23 is on community. Therefore, instead of asking you to submit an academic abstract following a specific structure, submissions to deRSE23 are a bit more free form.
 
For conference management we use the free french service [sciencesCONF](https://www.sciencesconf.org/) by the CCSD (Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe). You need to create an [account there](https://de-rse23.sciencesconf.org/user/createaccount), then simply fill out the [submission form](https://de-rse23.sciencesconf.org/user/submissions). The form includes a field for the description of your submission (“abstract”, 750 characters max!).

Submitting a contribution does not automatically register you for the conference, please remember to register your participation.


### Formats

#### competition for young RSE prize

If your RSE career just has started, you can participate for the young RSE prize 2023. Any of the formats below are valid. What is a young RSE? We consider people with a phd or master thesis from 2020 and onwards young RSE. Winners will be highlighted and will receive some trophy money. 

#### Talks

Talks may have a length of 15-30 mins., including time for Q&A and discussion, depending on the number of talks in the respective session. If your talk is accepted, you will be notified about the length of the talk by the session chair.

#### Posters

Posters are used to present an overview of an idea, a project, a collaboration, etc. Posters must be in portrait orientation and maximally up to A0 size (max. height: 1189mm; max. width: 841mm). Please be prepared to give a very short presentation about the contents of your poster in a “lightning talk”. This will help attendees of the poster session identify the posters and people they want to look at and talk to.

#### Demos

As an alternative to a printed poster you demonstrate your contribution to a limited number of people during the poster session. You will get a table and some space around it.

#### Workshops, etc

For workshops note that there is a workshop centric event planned for summer - [deRSE Unconference 2023](https://de-rse.org/unconf2023/). If you would like to run interactive and educative sessions please contact the [organisers](mailto:derse23orga@listserv.dfn.de).

We are looking forward to your contributions!
