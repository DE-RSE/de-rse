In June 2019, research software developers from all over Germany met for the first time for a central conference at [deRSE19](https://de-rse.org/en/conf2019/) in Potsdam. Ideas and plans for follow-up conferences in 2020 and 2021 were unfortunately thwarted by the pandemic. Therefore, de-RSE e.V. is now joining forces with colleagues from software engineering and organising a separate track on research software for [SE 2022](https://www.se-2022.de) of the Gesellschaft für Informatik (GI) in February 2022. 

The organising committee is looking forward to submissions for workshops, talks and posters, as well as for splinter meetings and informal "Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF)" discussion meetings. The aim of the conference is to map the diverse community of research software engineers through participation of all levels of experience across disciplines, locations, genders and origins.

## Timeline
*	RSE Track: **submission deadline ~~12.~~ 19.11.2021**
*	RSE Track: notification 3.12.2021
*	RSE Track: final program version 15.12.2021 
*	**Mo-Tue. 21. - 22.02.2022 - rSE22 workshops**
*	**Wed-Fri., 23. - 25.02.2022 - rSE22 conference**

## Conference sessions, topics and submission types
rSE22 is a track of the [SE 2022](https://www.se-2022.de) Conference of the GI with a focus on research software. The sessions within the track will be put together by the programme committee based on the submissions. If you have a work on a topic that could be of general interest to the research software community, we look forward to your submission!

## Who can submit?
We welcome submissions in German or English from anyone with an interesting contribution to research software. These include but are not limited to:
*	Researchers at all career levels who develop software for research purposes.
*	Software developers working in research contexts, regardless of job title or discipline.
*	Funders and decision-makers who pave the way for sustainable research software through funding and other tools.
*	People interested in improving our understanding of how to best develop and maintain research software, e.g. in terms of openness, reproducibility, sustainability or scalability and performance.
*	People from organisations that provide tools, platforms or services to support research software, e.g. IT infrastructure providers, data and data centres.

Our aim is to have a balanced programme that reflects the diversity of perspectives and the diversity of the RSE community and its activities. Similar conferences outside Germany have found that the humanities and social sciences have been underrepresented there, so we would like to explicitly invite RSE activists from these fields to submit.

We are not only looking for experienced, well-known or PhD speakers. Therefore, we would like to explicitly invite all individuals from underrepresented groups and early career researchers to submit as well!

Submissions will be reviewed in a "single-blind" process, which accommodates software-related submissions. This means that reviewers will be able to see the names and institutions of origin of authors.

## Contact
If you have any questions about the conference in general or specifically about submission, please contact the conference committee: <SE_2022@informatik.hu-berlin.de>.

## Contributions
The focus of rSE22 lies on the community. Therefore, we do not ask for formal academic abstracts, but. instead are looking for a brief description of the contribution.

Submissions of this years conference are managed via EasyChair. Click [**->here<-**](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=se2022) to start your submission. For the submission you first need to register an account in EasyChair. After successful login you then have to click on “make a new submission” and select the “SE2022 Research Software Engineering Track” to get to the submission page. 

We are looking for submissions in English as well as in German and will assume that the language of the abstract will also be the preferred language for the contribution. Additional notes can be provided as part of the contribution description.

## Topic bazaar
If you do not want to present a topic on your own or are looking for fellow participants to conduct a workshop, we recommend using the [rSE22 topic bazaar](https://pad.gwdg.de/B74SJsvmQbKRMkPAuLuQyA). This is a freely editable document with templates. There you enter your ideas or wishes and, if necessary, get in touch with other people to realise your idea.

## Formate
# Workshops, Splinter Meetings, BoFs
Workshops are pre-conference interactive formats that give participants the opportunity to collaborate on a specific topic. They can be organised in different ways, e.g. tutorial, discussion and [speed blogging](https://www.software.ac.uk/term/speed-blogging) session, hack session. Splinter meetings serve working groups with specific, sharply defined interests. Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) are informal meetings without a pre-planned agenda to exchange on a specific topic.

The Monday and Tuesday before the conference leave enough free space to realise such interactive formats. They can take place purely virtually or decentrally on site at the participants' own choice (room must be provided by the participants themselves).

Experience has shown that a length of 90 to 180 minutes is well suited for workshops. For splinter meetings and BoFs, a length of between 30 and 90 minutes is recommended. Please mention in your submission the intended length of the proposed session so that we can schedule it accordingly.

# Presentation
Presentations are 15-30 minutes long, including time for questions and discussion, depending on how many presentations are combined into one session. If your presentation is accepted, you will be informed of the length by the session chair.

# Poster
Posters present an idea, a project, a collaboration, etc. Posters must be in portrait format and must not exceed a size of A0 (height: max. 1189mm; width: max. 841mm) and must be available digitally as PDF. Please be prepared to present your poster in a very short "lightning talk". This will help conference participants identify the posters and people they would like to visit during the (virtual) poster session.
